## ALEX
![ALEX](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/mediawiki/images/0/04/Alex.png?style=centerme)
>“Alex loves sports and hanging out at the beach. He is quite arrogant and brags to everyone that he is going to be a professional athlete. Is his cockiness just a facade to mask his crushing self-doubt? Is he using his sports dream to fill the void left by the disappearance of his parents? Or is he just a brazen youth trying to 'look cool?'”

-  Spring  During Spring, Alex exits his home at 8am unless it is raining. 
He stands by the tree to the right of his house, 
and he moves towards the left of the fenced-in area in the afternoon.


+  Fall During Fall, he works out at the Spa almost every day. When he is not there, he will be at his house.

Shown below are Alex's schedules prioritized highest to lowest. 
For example, if it is raining, that schedule overrides all others.



!  Summer During Summer, he can be found on the beach in the morning 
and running the Ice Cream Stand to the left of the museum in the afternoon. 
On the 16th of Summer, he has an appointment at the clinic.

## Haley

>“Being wealthy and popular throughout high school has made Haley a little conceited and self-centered. She has a tendency to judge people for superficial reasons. But is it too late for her to discover a deeper meaning to life? Is there a fun, open-minded young woman hidden within that candy-coated shell?”

## Abigail

>“Abigail lives at the general store with her parents. She sometimes fights with her mom, who worries about Abigail’s “alternative lifestyle”. Her mom has the following to say: “I wish Abby would dress more appropriately and stop dyeing her hair blue. She has such a wonderful natural hair color, just like her grandmother did. Oh, and I wish she’d find some wholesome interests instead of this occult nonsense she’s into.” You might find Abigail alone in the graveyard, or maybe out in a rainstorm looking for frogs.”

## Sam

>“Sam is an outgoing, friendly guy who is brimming with youthful energy. He plays guitar and drums, and wants to start a band with Sebastian as soon as he has enough songs together. However, he does have a habit of starting ambitious projects and not finishing them. Sam is a little stressed about the impending return of his father, who has been away for years due to his line of work.”
