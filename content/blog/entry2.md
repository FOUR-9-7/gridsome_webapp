## The Beach

The Beach is located to the south of Pelican Town. It is a valuable area for Fishing, being the only source for all saltwater Fish. In addition, many shells and forageable items can be found washed up on the beach (especially during Summer 12-14).

During the Summer the Luau and Dance of the Moonlight Jellies festivals are held on the beach. In Winter, the Night Market is held on the pier from the 15th to the 17th.
